# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute and extend the list with new papers/knowledge. Please try to continue with the given classification (contractual/non-contractual) unless there is a novel subcategory that should be created. Let's explore the world of churn/CLV modelling and share the wisdom with scholars and practitioners alike!

## Guidelines

  * Follow the existing structure (model name in bold (year) - [doi_link] [pdf_link]), see the raw markdown file before making changes
  * Add one paper/tool per commit
  * No links to paid software tools! Open source only
  * The citation style used is APA7, remove the DOI link (it is added as a link)
  * Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
  * Check your spelling and grammar
  * Remove any trailing whitespace
  * Send a Pull Request with the reason why the paper/article is awesome
